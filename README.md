# trieregex

`trieregex` builds compact regular expressions from code points stored within a trie.

### Usage

```go
package main

import (
  "log"
	
  "github.com/n3integration/trieregex"
)

func main() {
  trie := trieregex.NewTrie()
  trie.Add("ham")
  trie.Add("spam")
  trie.Add("spearfish")

  re, err := trie.ToRegex()
  if err != nil {
    // handle err
  }

  if re.String() == `^(?:ham|sp(?:am|earfish))$` {
    log.Println(`ðŸŽ‰`)
  }
}
```
