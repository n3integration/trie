# trie

`trie` provides a generic trie implementation capable of building compact 
regular expressions from code points stored within the data structure.

### Usage

```go
package main

import (
	"log"

	"github.com/n3integration/trie"
)

func main() {
	t := trie.NewSet()
	t.Add("ham", struct{}{})
	t.Add("spam", struct{}{})
	t.Add("spearfish", struct{}{})

	re, err := t.ToRegex()
	if err != nil {
		// handle err
	}

	if re.String() == `^(?:ham|sp(?:am|earfish))$` {
		log.Println(`ðŸŽ‰`)
	}
}

```
